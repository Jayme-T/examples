# Simple example element (ipify)

[ipify](https://www.ipify.org/) provides a very simple API that returns the public IP address of the caller. This 
element implements a single resource (ip-address) and a single method (GET).

You can either import [ipify.json](ipify.json) via the UI or POST it to /elements to get started.
