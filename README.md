# examples
A collection of simple examples on how to use Cloud Elements.

The examples are organized by type:

### [Formulas](formulas)
A formula template is a reusable workflow that is independent of the element and includes the triggers, steps, and variables for a formula instance to execute the workflow. The steps in a formula template accomplish a wide variety of use cases across different services, such as keeping systems in sync, migrating data between systems, and automating business workflows.

### [Elements](elements)
Elements are pre-built API integration that enables a connection into a specific API Provider endpoint (e.g., Salesforce, Quickbooks, or Marketo). All elements start with a normalized set of features, including authentication, resources, paging, errors, events and search.

### [Virtual Data Resources (VDRs)](vdrs)
A virtual data resource is a stand-alone resource, created and defined by a user with the intention of creating a one-to-many transformation. Virtual data resources define normalized fields that you can use in place of specific elements to facilitate one-to-many integrations. You map fields from element resources to the virtual data resource fields to create transformations.
